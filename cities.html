        <p>
            Before coming to the USA, I've lived in some of the most happening cities
            in India. Below are some of the cities I've lived for both work and personal use.

                            Almost half of my life, I have lived in Hyderabad. I worked there for the last 5 years and
                            had some of my best memories of my life with my friends and loved ones. It is one of the
                            most happening places with respect to events and people.

                            Being my hometown, I have very special memories of my childhood. I did my schooling and
                            spent around 8 years in Warangal. Being a small town, I know almost all the local
                            restaurants and the food there is amazing. If i get a chance, I would like to stay there
                            when I'm old and retire.

                            The trip to Coorg was absolutely refreshing which make me feel alive, so, I stayed there for
                            almost 1 month. The journey through
                            winding roads, surrounded by lush green hills, was the perfect
                            escape from the city. I worked from there remotely and had a great time.
                            One of the highlights was visiting Abbey Falls which was worth the
                            trip and visited it like 5 times in the same month.

            Being in the USA, I got a chance to be able to visit few places I always wanted to go. Below are some of
            the cities I would really love to visit.

                            In most of the Indian films, there would be a clip shot in Niagara Falls which always peaked
                            my interest to visit. I would like to experience the falls first hand whenever I get a
                            chance.
